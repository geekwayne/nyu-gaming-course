Add the following to your game:
  1. **FB login**: Use [Login button](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/login/) and replace the `email` in the `Player` entity with a `fbId`.
  1. **FB like**: Add a [like button](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/like-button/).
  1. **FB friends**: Use [Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/user/#friends) and [it's GWT wrapper](https://github.com/olams/GwtFB/blob/master/src/com/gwtfb/sdk/FBCore.java) to load the user friends (their names and avatar URLs).


I recommend having at most one match with each friend (to simplify the UI).

Also add **one** of the following 3 features:
  1. **FB feed**: Use [Feed dialog](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/dialogs/feed/) to let a user brag about his win (only show the feed dialog after a user wins). (see [feed guidance](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/concepts/feed/)).
  1. **FB requests** : Use [requests](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/games/requests/) to send an invite to a new user.
  1. **FB notifications**: Use [Notifications](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/concepts/notifications/) to tell an existing user that a move was made. Only send one or two notifications to people each day.

As usual, you should upload your game to AppEngine (incrementing the version), and give a URL that the grader could use.

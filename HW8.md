The server team need to add support for ELO ranking:
The initial rank is 1500, and a rank is updated when a game ends using [Elo rating formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system#Mathematical_details) (you can use K=15). The containers should display the rank next to the player name(or break the ranks into buckets, such as beginner, intermediate, advanced; or show the rank when you hover above the name, etc).

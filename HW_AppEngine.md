This HW will focus just on planning and writing integration tests for the Server component V1-V3.

Read [Platform assignments](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15U_p6d901fov1rxNCyuZmOVF9NavASEuGIMf5AIGHTU/edit#heading=h.q1p0lxno9otu) and fill [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvLEQb_5Yz6RdHRmb3RReDFnSWJRWm1EakJaTGozSnc#gid=3) by Wednesday 5pm (those that won't fill it in will be assigned a team of my choosing). I'll slot you to teams on Wednesday evening.

Owners should create the github project, AppEngine application and design doc for their team (and fill it in the table in [Platform assignments](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15U_p6d901fov1rxNCyuZmOVF9NavASEuGIMf5AIGHTU/edit#heading=h.q1p0lxno9otu)), and write what you're planning to do for V1 until V3 (versions 1-3). You can assign jobs/assignments to your team members. Owners should collaborate with their team members to make sure everyone is on board.

The design doc should describe for each version what things the user could do in that version (in the form of [User stories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story)). It's OK to be aggressive and plan to do too much and at the end not do it - your grade will be calculated on what you achieved at the end (not on how accurate your plan was).

The UI teams will need to update/comment on the design doc of the Server team with the changes they'll need in Server API for each version.

The design docs should be finished by Saturday 5pm.

All teams should then write 3 pages for testing V1-V3 of the Server component: each page should contain 10-20 [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) calls to the correct version of the server (e.g., `2.appname.appspot.com`) and check the result is as expected. You can use any javascript testing framework you want, or GWT, or none at all.

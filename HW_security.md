I18n the game: translate all the strings and numbers in your game to another language. (If you don't know any other language other than English, then you can use [Google Translate](http://translate.google.com/) to translate to Spanish.) Use the [Messages](http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/latest/com/google/gwt/i18n/client/Messages.html) interface to create the user string (pass it the username/email, the rank, and anything else you wish to display). Make sure to [i18n date correctly](https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideCodingBasicsFormatting).

Submit version 4.

I18n your component to another language (obviously except the Server component, which shouldn't contain any strings for translation).

Make sure your game and component is secure (pay special attention to strings that the user can change, e.g., email and name).

Individually:
  * Build an additional 5 levels (so 10 levels in total).
  * Make sure to test your levels on a mobile device.
  * Upload your game to AppEngine and give the URL in your commit message.
  * I recommend using closure to make sure you don't have JavaScript errors.

If anyone is facing the problem with zoom-in and zoom-out on mobile, try adding the meta viewport tag to your game:
```
<meta name="viewport" content="height=device-height,width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"> 
```
You can change the permitted zoom-in and zoom-out levels using the initial-scale and maximum-scale.

As a group:
  * I divided you into two groups (each group has 5 engineers and 1 manager)
  * Merge all the levels in your group (60 levels) into one game.
  * The managers should come up with a plan for the next two group HWs (and execute them, making sure to coordinate between the engineers). The managers will present their plan next lesson, and talk to the engineers to make sure everything is clear.
  * The end goal is a game working on mobile devices with basic FB integration (the user **could** log into FB, but the user could also play the game without logging into FB).
  * The managers will have 30 minutes each in the next lesson to present their plan to divide the work in the remaining two HWs.

The first group:
  * Manager: Abhishek Ajit Jathan
  * Yiwei Li
  * Daniel Widjaja
  * Juan Pablo Munoz
  * Zeyu He
  * Micha-Jamie Guthmann

The second group:
  * Manager: Khen Price
  * Chaolun Ni
  * Jocelyn Schulz
  * Kevin Mullin
  * Shuo Li
  * Vedant Agrawal

Example of physics based games:
Where is my water, Cut the rope, [lemmings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmings_(video_game)), [Incredible machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incredible_Machine_(series)), Angry birds, etc.

If anyone is facing the problem with zoom-in and zoom-out on mobile, try adding the meta viewport tag to your game:
```
<meta name="viewport" content="height=device-height,width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"> 
```
You can change the permitted zoom-in and zoom-out levels using the initial-scale and maximum-scale.

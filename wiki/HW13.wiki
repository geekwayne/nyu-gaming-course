#summary FB app

Add the following to your game:
  # *FB login*: Use [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/login/ Login button] and replace the `email` in the `Player` entity with a `fbId`.
  # *FB like*: Add a [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/like-button/ like button].
  # *FB friends*: Use [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/user/#friends Graph API] and [https://github.com/olams/GwtFB/blob/master/src/com/gwtfb/sdk/FBCore.java it's GWT wrapper] to load the user friends (their names and avatar URLs).


I recommend having at most one match with each friend (to simplify the UI).

Also add *one* of the following 3 features:
  # *FB feed*: Use [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/dialogs/feed/ Feed dialog] to let a user brag about his win (only show the feed dialog after a user wins). (see [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/concepts/feed/ feed guidance]). 
  # *FB requests* : Use [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/games/requests/ requests] to send an invite to a new user. 
  # *FB notifications*: Use [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/concepts/notifications/ Notifications] to tell an existing user that a move was made. Only send one or two notifications to people each day.

As usual, you should upload your game to AppEngine (incrementing the version), and give a URL that the grader could use.

== Connect 4 heuristic == 
  # Odd square: is a square belonging to an odd row (1,3,5)
  # Even square: is a square belonging to an even row (2,4,6)
  # Threats: A threat is a group of three tokens of the same color which has the fourth square empty and also the square below the empty square is empty
  # Odd threat: is a threat in which the empty square is odd
  # Even threat: is a threat in which the empty square is even
  # If red (moves first) has an odd threat and black cannot connect four tokens anywhere else red will win.
  # If black (moves second) has an even threat and black cannot connect four tokens anywhere else black will win.
  # At the beginning of the game it is advantageous to place tokens in the central columns.

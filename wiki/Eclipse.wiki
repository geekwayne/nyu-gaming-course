  # Install SVN eclipse plugin: [http://www.eclipse.org/subversive/documentation/gettingStarted.php subversive] with [http://svnkit.com/download.php SVNKit Connectors] (if that fails, you can try [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-ecl-subversion/ subclipse])
  # Learn <a href="http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~scott/talks/svntutorial/lcc_subversion_tutorial.pdf">what is SVN</a> and <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-subversion/index.html">how to use it</a>. I also recommend installing [http://tortoisesvn.net/ tortoise SVN] if you have windows.
  # Get your [http://code.google.com/hosting/settings Google's SVN password]. You'll need it for the next stage to checkout the code.
  # From eclipse, checkout your project, follow [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-ecl-subversion/ these instructions]

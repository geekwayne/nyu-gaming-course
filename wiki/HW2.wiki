==Individual HW2==
Implement the logic for your game.
For example, [https://code.google.com/p/nyu-gaming-course-2013/source/browse/trunk/eclipse/src/org/simongellis/hw2/StateChangerImpl.java state changer for chess].

== Group HW2 ==
Build a roadmap, and add it to [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YyhLG0aKsBZe18udbKUo8d79bKqWMXkW-eZVh6SJOXI/edit#slide=id.p our slides].
Plan to have a basic version working on FB in 6 lessons and a mobile app in 8 lessons. Afterward improve with iteration based on user feedback.

Add two modules (each module should contain 10-20 words) to our common database, each module should have the words in at least 2 languages.
Each modules is a directory with a certain structure, e.g., for the colors module we will have:
{{{
/colors/
/colors/words.js
/colors/yellow.jpg
/colors/red.jpg
...
}}}
The file `words.js` should be in JSON and have the following format:
{{{
{
  'yellow': {'en': 'yellow', 'es': 'amarillo'},
  'red': {'en': 'red', 'es': 'rojo'},
   ...
}
}}}

#summary HW2


==Individual HW2==
Implement the logic for your game.
For example, [https://code.google.com/p/nyu-gaming-course-2013/source/browse/trunk/eclipse/src/org/simongellis/hw2/StateChangerImpl.java state changer for chess].

== Group HW2 ==
Build a roadmap, and add it to [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YyhLG0aKsBZe18udbKUo8d79bKqWMXkW-eZVh6SJOXI/edit#slide=id.p our slides].
Plan to have a basic version working on FB in 6 lessons and a mobile app in 8 lessons. Afterward improve with iteration based on user feedback.


===Building the vocabulary content together===
Add 100 words to our list of modules (each module should contain 10-400 words) in this [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvLEQb_5Yz6RdGtBTDlpR2tYTzFLOV9Yb2o4bFdzRXc#gid=0 spreadsheet]. We will use these words for our common database of words.
Make sure not to work on words/list that someone else is adding,
and don't forget to only add words in your columns.

Here are some ideas:
[http://www.manythings.org/vocabulary/lists/a/ Basic Vocabulary Word Lists], 
[http://www.manythings.org/vocabulary/lists/b/ Beginner Vocabulary], 
[http://www.manythings.org/vocabulary/lists/c/ Comprehensive lists], 
[http://www.manythings.org/vocabulary/lists/l/ long lists],
[http://www.manythings.org/vocabulary/lists/2/ word pairs],
[http://www.manythings.org/vocabulary/lists/l/words.php?f=ogden-picturable these nouns]

The IDs are entities in [http://www.freebase.com/ freebase], e.g., 
[http://www.freebase.com/m/088fh yellow] and
[http://www.freebase.com/m/019sc black].
Note that freebase contains pictures and translation to other languages.

In a later assignment we will use freebase API to extract the photos and translations.

For example, [https://code.google.com/p/nyu-gaming-course-2013/source/browse/trunk/eclipse/src/org/simongellis/hw2/StateChangerImpl.java state changer for chess].

= Group HW2 =
Plan your game and build a roadmap.
Plan to have a prototype running in 6 lessons, 
then improve with iteration (have a new feature to show for us every lesson and get feedback from us),
and finally leave the last 2 lessons for bug fixing and load testing.

Add two slides to [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YyhLG0aKsBZe18udbKUo8d79bKqWMXkW-eZVh6SJOXI/edit#slide=id.p our slides]:
  # Describe your game with "printscreens" (draw some screens from your game).
  # Your roadmap: it should have 12 steps (each lesson you should complete one step).

#summary Easter Egg hunt: Physics game HW2

Individually:
  * Build an additional 5 levels (so 10 levels in total).
  * Make sure to test your levels on a mobile device.
  * Upload your game to AppEngine and give the URL in your commit message.
  * I recommend using closure to make sure you don't have JavaScript errors.

As a group:
  * I divided you into two groups (each group has 5 engineers and 1 manager)
  * Merge all the levels in your group (60 levels) into one game.
  * The managers should come up with a plan for the next two group HWs (and execute them, making sure to coordinate between the engineers). The managers will present their plan next lesson, and talk to the engineers to make sure everything is clear. 
  * The end goal is a game working on mobile devices with basic FB integration (the user *could* log into FB, but the user could also play the game without logging into FB).

The first group:
  * Manager: Abhishek Ajit Jathan
  * Yiwei Li
  * Daniel Widjaja
  * Juan Pablo Munoz
  * Zeyu He
  * Micha-Jamie Guthmann

The second group:
  * Manager: Khen Price
  * Chaolun Ni
  * Jocelyn Schulz
  * Kevin Mullin
  * Shuo Li
  * Vedant Agrawal

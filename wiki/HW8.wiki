  # I18n the game: translate all the strings and numbers in your game to another language. (If you don't know any other language other than English, then you can use [http://translate.google.com/ Google Translate] to translate to Spanish.) Use the [http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/latest/com/google/gwt/i18n/client/Messages.html Messages] interface to create the user string (pass it the username/email, the rank, and anything else you wish to display).
  # Add a `startDate` property to the match entity, and display the start date in the UI. Make sure to [https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideCodingBasicsFormatting i18n the date correctly].
  # Add a 'rank' property to the player entity, and display the rank (in Elo) or the rank range (`[rank-2*RD,rank+2*RD]` in Glicko) of a player next to its name/email (make sure to i18n it using [http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/latest/com/google/gwt/i18n/client/Messages.html Messages]). If your last name starts with a letter after 'N' then use [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system#Mathematical_details Elo], otherwise use [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glicko_rating_system Glicko]. The initial rank is 1500, and a rank is updated when a game ends using [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system#Mathematical_details Elo rating formula] (you can use K=15) or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glicko_rating_system#Determination Glicko formula] (you should use `t=x` if `x` days passed since the last game, and calculate `c` so that after a year of not playing the `RD` will be 350, i.e., like an unrated player). 
  # Make sure your game is secure (pay special attention to strings that the user can change, e.g., email and name).

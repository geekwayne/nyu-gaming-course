#summary HW5

==Group HW== 
Submit version 2.

==Individual HW==
Advanced graphics: animations for the moves, drag-n-drop the pieces, sounds (for the moves and for ending the game).

If your can't support drag-n-drop in any reasonable way (e.g., a poker game), then just add drag-n-drop to two labels `drag me` and `drag onto me` and change the size/color of the labels on drag over and drop events.

As usual, upload your game to your AppEngine, and write the URL in the commit message. Make sure to increment the `version` number in your `appengine-web.xml` so the grader could still access the old HW. I recommend setting the `version` number to the HW number.

Make sure that your game will still work even in old browsers that do not support these features.

You should be able to move the pieces using two ways:
  # Just by clicking - then you should see an animation of the piece moving.
  # drag-n-drop - then there shouldn't be any animation (the piece should just appear in the destination).

#summary HW5

Advanced graphics: animations for the moves, drag-n-drop the pieces, sounds (for the moves and for ending the game), save&load (using local storage).

Make sure that your game will still work even in old browsers that do not support these features.

You should be able to move the pieces using two ways:
  # Just by clicking - then you should see an animation of the piece moving.
  # drag-n-drop - then there shouldn't be any animation (the piece should just appear in the destination).

==Short bio about the lecturer==
[http://flash-together.appspot.com/yoavzibin/CV.pdf Yoav Zibin] did his PhD in the Technion, a postdoc in MIT, worked in IBM research, and now in Google NYC.
He co-founded and worked for 3 years in a multiplayer gaming startup called [http://www.come2play.com Come2Play] (0.5 million monthly FB users for its Chess app, and 6M likes to its [https://www.facebook.com/PlayChess?fref=ts Chess page]).

==Short course description==

The course will teach how to develop online casual multiplayer games
for web and mobile, using open technologies such as [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/ GWT], [AppEngine], DHTML, JSON, AJAX, long-polling, HTML5, PhoneGap, etc.

[Grading]:
The course has two big projects (broken into multiple HWs): 
  * 50% of the grade for a game project: A multiplayer game with graphics for the web and mobile, practice mode with artificial-intelligence, save and load, animations, sounds, mobile UI, etc. The individual project is broken down into HWs (due almost every week).
  * 50% of the grade for a [https://docs.google.com/document/d/15U_p6d901fov1rxNCyuZmOVF9NavASEuGIMf5AIGHTU/edit platform project] where the entire class will work as a team and each student will own a feature.

The course will also teach about ranking systems, artificial intelligence for games, leaderboards, tournaments,
realtime and turn-based games, and advanced graphics such as drag-n-drop, touch screen, sounds, animations, etc.

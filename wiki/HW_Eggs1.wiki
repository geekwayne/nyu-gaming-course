#summary Easter Egg hunt: Physics game HW1

Each student should build 5 levels in the Egg hunt game using
[http://box2d-js.sourceforge.net/index2.html JavaScript Box2D] or [https://code.google.com/p/box2dweb/wiki/BasicUsage Box2DWeb].

As usual, upload the game to your AppEngine and give the URL in your commit message.
I'll choose the best game next week, and we'll work together on extending it.

= Easter Egg hunt game =
There are several eggs and you need to collect them in a basket and on the way you decorate them (the eggs hit a special decoration object).
You need to collect at least one egg to pass a level, but you should collect as many as possible (catch-them-all!).

The game will have several easter eggs (balls) that you need to bring to a final destination and decorate them along the way,
like a combination between "Where is my water" (but with balls instead of water to make the physics simpler), "Cut the rope", and any other physics game you like (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmings_(video_game) lemmings], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incredible_Machine_(series) Incredible machine], etc). The eggs could smash, you could have different types of eggs (exploding, metallic, rubber, delicate, oil/powder filled, toxic, ), different types of paths (fixed walls, you could dig your own paths in dirt, sticky paths) and other mechanics (ropes, moving beams, trampoline, triggers, etc). 


In *later HWs* we'll add other components to the game, such as
  * Level selector, and grouping the levels into themes.
  * Splash loading screen
  * Navigation: Main menu, selecting theme and level
  * Pause and retry
  * Show score (time bonus, egg bonus, decoration bonus)
  * Saving to local storage
  * Login to FB, social features and save on AppEngine
  * Nice UI using Google Web Designer (GWD)

#summary Mobile HW

Convert your graphics to support a mobile/tablet WEB (i.e., surfing to a your site using a mobile browser).
You should do it for both your individual game and your component (the Server team should help the login team to convert their UI to mobile).

  * Surf to your appspot website from a mobile device, and make sure everything works as expected.
  * Make sure dragging on mobile works, and if it doesn't then fix it. See [https://code.google.com/p/gwt-dnd/ gwt-dnd]

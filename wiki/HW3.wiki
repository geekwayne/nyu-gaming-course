#summary HW3

Graphics for your game (MVP + unit tests for Presenters).
See the skeleton of Yoav Zibin's HW3 [https://code.google.com/p/nyu-gaming-course-2013/source/detail?r=468 here].

You should be able to play your game in the browser with yourself, i.e., two human players playing in the same browser (there is no artificial intelligence).

Upload your game to AppEngine, and add a link to your game in your commit message. Note that in this HW, you do not have any server-side code (you only upload HTML, JS, and CSS to AppEngine).

You may copy code from last year's course:
  # Chinese chess: [https://code.google.com/p/gaming-platform/source/browse/trunk/eclipse/gaming-platform/src/org/gaming/client/games/xiangqi/XiangqiGraphics.java View] and [https://code.google.com/p/gaming-platform/source/browse/trunk/eclipse/gaming-platform/src/org/gaming/client/games/xiangqi/XiangqiGraphics.ui.xml UiBinder] and [https://code.google.com/p/gaming-platform/source/browse/trunk/eclipse/gaming-platform/src/org/gaming/client/games/xiangqi/XiangqiPresenter.java Presenter]
  # Checkers: [https://code.google.com/p/gaming-platform/source/browse/trunk/eclipse/gaming-platform/src/org/gaming/client/games/checkers/Graphics.java View] and [https://code.google.com/p/gaming-platform/source/browse/trunk/eclipse/gaming-platform/src/org/gaming/client/games/checkers/Graphics.ui.xml UiBinder] and [https://code.google.com/p/gaming-platform/source/browse/trunk/eclipse/gaming-platform/src/org/gaming/client/games/checkers/Presenter.java Presenter]
  


Example of how mockito was used last semester to test the Presenter class:
[https://code.google.com/p/nyu-gaming-course-2013/source/browse/trunk/eclipse/test/org/simongellis/hw3/PresenterTest.java?spec=svn529&r=529 PresenterTest with Mockito]
The relevant code:
{{{
        @Before
        public void setup() {
                presenter = new Presenter();
                view = Mockito.mock(Presenter.View.class);
                ...
                HasClickHandlers dummyResetButton = Mockito.mock(HasClickHandlers.class);
                when(view.getResetButton()).thenReturn(dummyResetButton);
                presenter.setView(view);
        }

        @Test
        public void testCheckmateDisplayed() {
                GameResult whiteCheckmate = new GameResult(Color.WHITE, GameResultReason.CHECKMATE);
                ...
                State state = new State(
                                Color.BLACK,
                                board,
                                ...
                                whiteCheckmate);
                presenter.setState(state);
                verify(view).setGameResult(whiteCheckmate);
        }
}}}


You will need to start a GWT project for HW3. This URL explains how to create an empty GWT project (I recommend letting eclipse generating sample code - it will make things easier on you):
[http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/tutorial/create.html#create GWT tutorial].
After you created the sample GWT project, then you can copy your java classes to the "shared" directory (that directory is shared between server and client code). Then create a state instance from the GWT code, and make sure GWT compilation succeeds. Then continue to building the UI.

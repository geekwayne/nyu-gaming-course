#summary Grading

There will be 14 lessons, 14 individual home works (HWs) of equal weight (70% of the final grade), and one group assignment (30% of the final grade).

Create your own individual project and your group project (on Google code) and add them to our [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvLEQb_5Yz6RdHRmb3RReDFnSWJRWm1EakJaTGozSnc#gid=2 spreadsheet].

=Individual HWs=
Each individual assignment will be submitted into your individual project using a *single commit* any time before our lecture starts.
The *deadline is strict* - any submission after the deadline will not be graded.

The grader will go over your committed code, review it and give you feedback and your grade for that HW.
You are encouraged to fix the problems pointed by the grader (and avoid making them in future HWs).

*No copying!!!*
All work is individual - no team work is allowed.
Copying will be dealt with harshly (i.e., failing the course).

 
=Group assignment=
Divide into teams of 3-4 students, and work on whatever gaming project you want.
The project is due before the last lecture.
You will present your work several times during the course to show your progress and get feedback and direction.

You may commit as often as you like into your group project, and team work is obviously encouraged (but don't copy code from other teams).

#summary Grading

There will be 8-12 game homeworks (HWs) of equal weight (50% of the final grade), and 5-8 platform homeworks (50% of the final grade).
Each HW will be submitted into the github project using a *single commit* (to make grading easier).

Add your email and name to our [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvLEQb_5Yz6RdHRmb3RReDFnSWJRWm1EakJaTGozSnc#gid=3 spreadsheet].
We will use the spreadsheet to track what everyone are working on.

=Game HWs=
The game HW deadline is always the same: any time before our lecture starts.
The *deadline is strict* - any submission after the deadline will be penalized as follows:
  * 1-day late: 1 grade below (A to A-, A- to B+, etc; the grades are: A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, etc)
  * 2-day late: 2 grades below (A to B+, etc)
  * 3-day late: 3 grades below
  * 4-day late: 4 grades below
  * 5-day late: won't be graded.

The grader will go over your committed code, review it and give you feedback and your grade for that HW.

 
=Platform HWs=
We will all work together on building a gaming platform ([https://github.com/yoav-zibin/multiplayer-gaming-platform/ GitHub multiplayer gaming platform project]).

Each student will own a *feature*, write a design doc for it, implement it, test it, and launch it. 
See examples and deadlines in the [https://docs.google.com/document/d/15U_p6d901fov1rxNCyuZmOVF9NavASEuGIMf5AIGHTU/edit platform assignments doc].

Some students will have additional roles (and they will own smaller features), such as release engineer and component owner.

The feature will usually require changes in several *components* (emulator, game container, server, documentation, developer console, etc).
Each *component* will have an owner whose job is to *review* all changes to it, test changes, and make sure the component is consistent and functional. The owners will also describe and rank what contributions each student made to their component.

You may copy code from anywhere on the internet as long it is clearly marked with a URL pointing to the source.
